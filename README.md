Case Study: FIFA-MoneyBall


Brief overview of analytical processes


Objective:

Build a regression model based on the train data set to predict the OVA score for footballers in test data.

What we did:

•	We started by studying the data and noticed that different types of players had different abilities and playing styles. For example, a goalkeeper has different skills than a midfielder or a defender.

•	Created 4 regression models for 4 different categories: Goalkeeper, Defence, Midfield and Attack 

•	Applied this data to the test data (seperated this data also into 4 postiions: Goalkeeper, Defence, Midfield and Attack)

•	Got the 3 footballers with the highest OVA and under the budget

The mean absolute error (MAE) for our regression models – a measure of how accurate our predictions were – were as follows:

**Goalkeeper**

0.2745587887799759

**Defence**

1.00683400767267

**Midfield** 

1.3396425816041848

**Attack**

0.4362952456631845


We chose players from the following models:
Goalkeeper, Defence, and Attack

**Players that we chose:**

M. Neuer predicted OVA = 88, value = €29M

L. Suárez	predicted OVA = 87,   value = €31.5M

P. Lahm predicted OVA = 87, value = €29.5M


We had €100 million in the beginning. After selecting the three players, we were left with €10 million, successfully managing to stay within our budget while selecting top-rated players.
